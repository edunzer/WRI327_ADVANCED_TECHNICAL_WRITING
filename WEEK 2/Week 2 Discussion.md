## WEEK 2 DISCUSSION

Then, answer the following question:

  How does the technical description that you chose apply the genre expectations and writing components/strategies discussed in Markel's Chapter 20?

  Incorporate the ideas of Markel and write one paragraph analyzing how the technical description does or does not apply the genre components/strategies mentioned in Chapter 20. For where you see lacking application of Markel's genre strategies, discuss what revisions you think would help improve the technical description.

    - In the "How Hybrids Work" technical definition there are several writing components that were demonstrated and outlined in the reading of Markel Chapter 20. First off we have "Principle of Operation" which works to give an example of how something works. This is done in the "partitioned" sections of the description where each major component of hybrid technology is given and then explains how it operates. These two writing components seem most important to me in a technical definition because they allow for quick and easy information transfer.  

    - This technical definition also ends each description with a brief conclusion such as "This generates electricity and help slow the vehicle". This technique is also outlined in the text and helps conclude longer definitions for a more concrete piece of information.
