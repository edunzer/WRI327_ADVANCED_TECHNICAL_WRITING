## WEEK # DISCUSSION

1. The author of this manual does not define any terms.  What terms might need to be defined to a user who is not at all familiar with the Kindle and who may never have purchased a electronic book?  Please note that I am not asking you to define any terms.  However, I am asking you to identify what terms might need to be defined.

  - The main terms are what a kindle fire is used for, what version he is using, and what are kindle books. This will enable a completely new user to better understand the topic of eBooks, along with why he is using kindle fire for accessing them. There should also be more of an explanation about how the kindle works and revolves around amazons eBook ecosystem.

2. The author begins immediately with the instructions. He does not start off with an introduction to the device or an explanation of why one would want to know how to use the device. What would a suitable introduction be for the target audience (write a possible introduction)?

  - The introduction of simple video like this needs to state the purpose of the video right away with any relevant/important information. So for instance saying "Hi everyone, today I'm going to show you how to access books for your amazon kindle fire" would be a much more informative start. Then after this statement you can suggest more about what is in the video or give more relevant details like what the amazon kindle fire is or what version he is using.
