## ASSIGNMENT #1 | CLIENT PROJECT PROPOSAL

Introduction

  The client of this project is Appalachia Publishing Collective (APC). APC is a small organization who specializes in publishing books by Appalachian authors about topics of interest in the Appalachian region. Maria Burdett, who is the chairwoman of the Appalachia Publishing Collective, was originally the one that reached out to New Age Systems (NAS) and is the head of this project on APC's side.

  This project proposal has been brought on by APC’s need to expand and capitalize on their current standing in the publishing house market. The goal of APC to increase their business growth by 85% over the next 3 years. This will be achieved by creating better tracking then the current system has to offer, create better relationships with authors, creating a better outreach process to help their appearance to outside authors, and to adjust there “ideal market image” by what is trending.

  As an employee of NAS my role would be as a consultant who is in charge of systems analyst and project management for this individual project for APC. I will be communicating with many members/employees from APC but mostly will be dealing with Ms. Burdett when it comes to decision making and project overview.


Detailed Description of Scope of Work (body sections)

  APC's venture into a new business model will require them to upgrade all current workstations and printers, along with adding more for future employees. They will also have to explore cost and feasibility options for server storage for all their future digital documents. This technical information is not important for the immediate APC team but will need to be explained to Ms. Burdett to get approval.

  The new system not only has to upgrade hardware components of their current system but also the functionality of it. In order to streamline their new business processes, they need to shift from a paper-based system to digital in order to keep accurate and better track of their projects.   It is important that the APC team understands how these new systems will work along with help their overall productivity. A detailed explanation of the new system will need to be put together for a non-technical audience.


Conclusion

  APC's venture into a new business area comes with a great need to explore the technical environment, which opens up a wide range of possibilities for me to explore. All the above topics and system requirements were chosen based on the customers’ needs and potential wants in the future. I hope to outline a successful plan of action for APC and also meet all their expectations for their new business venture.
