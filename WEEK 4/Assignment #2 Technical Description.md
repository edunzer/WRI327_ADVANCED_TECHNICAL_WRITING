## ASSIGNMENT #2 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

Introduction

  In order to streamline their new business processes, APC needs to shift from a paper-based system to digital in order to keep accurate and better track of their projects. This will help with efficiency, but also information loss which they detailed as a huge problem in their current system. Since all projects will be digital, they can be further organized and categorized by genre and trend to make decisions for the collective easier.

  This technical description will be a great overall outline for the APC team to review and look through when training to use their new system that is being developed. Then when future explanation is needed more in-depth documents can be reviewed. The APC workflow description is as follows:

Conclusion

  The new workflow process that APC will utilize is entirely digital system that will allow for multi system integration. This means that there will be separate systems that are in-charge of certain smaller business processes in a digital format.

  Pending testing and changes the new APC workflow system will completely change the way that they go about their day-to-day work. All files will be digital, and be exchanged, edited, and tracked digitally. This will eliminate previous problems that APC had in the pass, along with optimizing their performance for future business endeavors like electronic media.
