## WEEK 1 DISCUSSION

1. After reading this week's materials, how would you define technical writing to a fellow student who has not yet taken this course?

     Technical writing is a different style of writing that is used and coveted in technical environments. This is most commonly in the workplace where normal "fluffy" writing styles that are taught in lower grades of school are not welcome. Technical writing encourages the writer to not only present there writing in a efficient manor that thoroughly explains the subject but also adapts to the readers potential knowledge of the subject. These details are important because of the environment where technical writing is used, a.k.a the workplace, where knowledge needs to be transferred from person to person in a quick effective manor. 

2. What are some similarities and differences between technical writing, academic writing, and creative writing?

    The purpose of all these types of writing is to educate and inform and that is really where the similarities end for creative writing. Creative writing is mainly to entertain tha audience while giving them information. On the other hand technical and academic put no effort in keeping the readers interest throughout the writing. Instead both aim at providing solid information that is backed up whether it is point of view based like academic writing or subject based like technical writing. Technical writing aims to present results of research or demonstrate knowledge instead of point of view. This means that the writing style of technical writing becomes less personal then academic and is therefore the purest of writing styles. 

3. Read the following passages. Who is the audience for each and how do you know? What level of technicality would you classify each as (expert, technician, executive, nonspecialist)?

    - “Auscultation and EKG revealed a massive cardiac infarction and pulmonary edema marked by pronounced cyanosis.”

        This would be for an Expert audience. There is little to no explanation of any of the terms or situation and is filled with technical words that lead to a quick explanation of what happened. This would require alot of background knowledge to understand fully. 

    - “Examination by stethoscope and electrocardiogram revealed a massive failure of the heart muscle along with fluid buildup in the lungs, which produced a cyanotic discoloration of the lips and fingertips from lack of oxygen.”

        This could be for a Technician based audience. There is technical knowledge included such as the names "stethoscope" and "electrocardiogram" but there is also explanation that supports the subject matter to make sure the reader understands what is being said. 

    - “Heart sounds and electrical impulses were abnormal, indicating a massive heart attack caused by failure of a large part of the heart muscle. The lungs were swollen with fluid and the lips and fingertips were discolored blue from lack of oxygen.”

        This audience would be nonspecialists. There are several parts of the subject that have been omitted by the writer and changed to vague subject fillers, such as "large part of the heart muscle" instead of the technical name. It also makes sure to lay out what exactly is happening to support that subject matter.
