## WEEK 9 DISCUSSION

After completing the revising and/or proofreading exercise, reflect on how this revising/editing strategy worked for you. Answer the following discussion questions, using details and examples to explain your responses:

  - How comfortable were you with using this revising and/or proofreading strategy? (Discuss whether or not you have tried this strategy before and the ease or difficulty you had with applying this strategy to your own writing).

    I found that using the reverse outlining strategy was extremely helpful and easy to do when review large texts of information that I had written. I have used this strategy idea before when reviewing my work but never went as far as writing down each topic next to the paragraph.

  - How effective do you think this strategy was for helping you find errors or weaknesses in your own writing? How effective do you think this strategy would be for finding errors or weaknesses in someone else's writing? (In other words - do you think this particular strategy is more effective when applied to your own writing (familiar text) or to a peer's text (less familiar), and why do you think so?)

    Overall I think this is a great way to make sure that lengthy pieces of writing stay on topic and are answering the write questions. I found it very effective and I think it would work in any scenario where a paper or piece of writing has a clear topic in mind. If this was true for another persons paper I think the same could be true and this strategy would work great as long as you know the purpose of the writing.

  - Talk about the writing concerns your were able to identify using the revision strategy (provide specific passages and/or lists of grammatical errors you found).

    I for one have often written a large paper and half way through I started going into detail about a separate topic that didn't relate to the thesis. Using this strategy would help identify this problem along with making sure that the flow of information was correct throughout the paper. Being able to label the purpose of each section of writing really enables you to polish the work and make sure that there is a flow to the information.

  - Talk about the revisions you need to make going forward to finalize your completion report (provide specific details about the plans you have for revising).

    Considering that most of the technical documents that we have created this far are all filled with technical information I don't think this strategy would be very beneficial. Most of my technical documents already have labeled sections and simple to the point writing that is there for the sole purpose of providing information so making sure that each section is "on topic" doesn't really make sense.
