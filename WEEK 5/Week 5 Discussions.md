## WEEK 5 DISCUSSIONS

f. the reasons you chose your college or major

  For this topic I choose "Problem-methods-solution" as the most effective organizational pattern to follow. By using this method I am able to discuss the problem between my major and projected career needs. Then the steps that I took to view all majors that were available to solve that problem, and then the outcome of what major I picked and why.

h. two music-streaming services

  For this topic I choose "Comparison and contrast" as the most effective organizational pattern to follow. It is relatively obvious but all that needs to be done is compare and contrast similarities of the different music services. This would most likely be done in method 1 of compare and contrast where I would discuss all factors of the items instead of just one.  

k. college courses

  For this topic I choose "Classification or partition" as the most effective organizational pattern to follow. By using this Classification I am able to organize all the college courses into effective categories that relate to there topics. Then I would partition the classifications in order to explain the different courses individually.
