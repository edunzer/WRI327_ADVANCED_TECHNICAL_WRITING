## WEEK 8 DISCUSSION

1. List 3 Dos and 3 Don'ts of giving oral presentations. (Your response may focus on design aspects of a presentation or delivery aspects of a presentation.)

  Do's
    - Be organized
    - Speak clearly and at an appropriate pace for the audience
    - Move around if possible to keep attention

  Don'ts
    - Don't try to cover more then the audience can handle
    - Follow the information that was planned but do not read said information
    - Don't turn away from the audience

2. Examine one of the following PowerPoint presentations: Cars & Technology (Links to an external site.) or Bees are Wonderful (Links to an external site.)

  Who is the intended audience and purpose of the presentation?
    - The intended audience for the "Bees are Wonderful" presentation is someone that doesn't know anything about bees and has a very basic learning potential.

  What characteristics of an effective slide are present? Need to be met (with revisions)?
    - The slides are simple and provide good information about the topic. They also have pictures to keep the audience interested.

  What top 3 revisions would you suggest to improve the overall look & feel and use of graphics?
    - The colors need to change in order to make the slides more readable. This also goes for the fonts and colors of the fonts. Some of the slides could also be separated into independent slides to make it easier to understand, like the slide about the different kinds of bees.
