## EXTRA INFO FOR CLIENT PROJECT

This project proposal has been brought on by APC’s need to expand and capitalize on their current standing in the publishing house market. The goal of APC to increase their business growth by 85% over the next 3 years. This will be achieved by creating better tracking then the current system has to offer, create better relationships with authors, creating a better outreach process to help their appearance to outside authors, and to adjust there “ideal market image” by what is trending.

The new system not only has to upgrade hardware components of their current system but also the functionality of it. In order to streamline their new business processes, they need to shift from a paper-based system to digital in order to keep accurate and better track of their projects. This will help with efficiency, but also information loss which they detailed as a huge problem in their current system. Since all projects will be digital, they can be further organized and categorized by genre and trend to make decisions for the collective easier.


APC’s new venture into their system update will increase their value as a business in several key areas. First it will solve their most notable problems that all involve lack of organization through not having a digital ecosystem. By creating a digital environment to take in manuscripts and store information about them as well as authors, trends, and published books there will be more information to look over and analyze for the future. This will not only help them after the initial upgrade, but it will also enable them to be in a better position in the future when they have more expansion or change.

Given APC’s current position in the market as a publishing house with very little overhead they can initiate these changes with the opportunity to bring in more revenue with almost no increase to their current overhead discounting the potential hiring that would give them 11 total employees.
