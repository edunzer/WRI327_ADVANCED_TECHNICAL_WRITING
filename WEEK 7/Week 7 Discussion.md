## WEEK 7 DISCUSSION

Having now completed readings on usability and having started the usability assessment process of a peer's technical description and technical instruction drafts - explain the differences between formal usability testing and an expert review/heuristic review. What are the key differences in the methods and the results in these two types of assessments? What are the pros and cons with each type of assessment?

  Overall the two are both trying to review something to find errors or issues that could come up later. Usability is a user-centered interaction where the item is evaluated by a potential user. This often results in typical user interactional and requires you to know who the target audience is so that you can put together that user profile to test. Heuristics on the other hand is more a of complex measuring and checking method where someone will look over the entire item with prior need knowledge and see if it contains such items. This often results in evaluations that are more complex and not apparent to the "normal audience".

  So the main differences being:

  Usability testing

    Performed by potential user with no limited knowledge
    Are tasked to preform a specific set of actions
    Can find real user problems
    Has no knowledge of what should be there or not there

  Heuristic evaluation

    Performed by professionals with knowledge
    Has set list of items to check for
    Can find defined item problems potential problems
    Cannot find potential user problems

  Both of these methods are helpful when trying to find usability issues that could come up later on when the real users are involved. They can allow you to catch problems early on and change them to meet requirements. But only usability testing can allow you to catch problems that potential users will have with the item. Heuristic often creates a blinding effect for involved parties because they are set to search for a set of items that are apparent to the party that created the item. This often results in missed problems that were not perceived by the creating party.
